# 🕰️ Luxury Watch "Carat" Rating Predictor — ML-Powered Luxury Index

## Overview

**LuxuryWatch-MachineLearning** is a data-driven project that predicts the *luxury scale* of wristwatches using a custom metric referred to as **"carats"**, a metaphorical index inspired by the way Rotten Tomatoes scores movies. This creative metric encapsulates subjective and objective watch attributes—such as brand heritage, material quality, design sophistication, and consumer sentiment—into a unified luxury score.

This project leverages machine learning techniques to blend expert intuition and data insights, resulting in a smart, scalable system to classify and score watches across the spectrum—from mainstream to ultra-luxury.

## 🚀 Purpose

Luxury in the watch world is not just about price—it’s about perception, rarity, craftsmanship, and brand narrative. However, quantifying "luxury" remains an abstract challenge. This project:

* Bridges **subjective luxury perception** with **objective data features**.
* Helps collectors, sellers, and buyers evaluate watches using a **standardized, data-backed scale**.
* Enables new forms of **watch classification**, **market segmentation**, and **value forecasting**.

---

## 🔍 Methodology

The project builds a supervised ML pipeline to predict the *"carat rating"* of watches based on diverse features.

### 🔧 Data Sources (example/placeholder)

* Watch specifications (case material, movement type, dial complexity)
* Brand prestige scores (computed from auction sales, reviews, historical brand rank)
* Design & aesthetic attributes (colorway, minimalist vs ornate, etc.)
* Market pricing (retail and resale)
* Community sentiment (optional NLP via reviews and forums)

### 📊 Features Engineered

* **Material Index**: weighted score based on material rarity and quality
* **Brand Heritage Score**: reputation quantified over time
* **Design Complexity Metric**: handcrafted from design taxonomies
* **Market Positioning Vector**: compares list vs resale prices
* **Sentiment Embeddings (optional)**: via LLM/NLP from collector forums

### 🤖 ML Models Explored

* Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost, LightGBM)
* Random Forest for interpretability
* Neural networks (for embeddings/NLP)
* Model stacking or ensembling for improved accuracy

## 💎 What is the "Carat" Rating?

The **Carat Rating** (0 to 10 scale) is a proprietary composite score reflecting the perceived luxury level of a watch.
It’s built to be:

* **Interpretable** — Clear reasoning behind each score via SHAP or feature importance
* **Relative** — Scores relative to the full dataset, not absolute price
* **Flexible** — Can evolve with time, sentiment, and changing luxury standards

## 🧪 Sample Use Case

```python
from src.predict import predict_carat_score

sample_watch = {
  "brand": "Rolex",
  "material": "18K Yellow Gold",
  "movement": "Automatic",
  "design": "Classic Dress Watch",
  "retail_price": 25000,
  "resale_price": 30000,
  "sentiment_score": 0.87
}

carat = predict_carat_score(sample_watch)
print(f"Predicted Carat Rating: {carat}/10")
```

## 🎯 Applications

* **Luxury marketplaces** for curated pricing insights
* **Watch collectors** building balanced portfolios
* **AI-powered recommendation engines** for timepieces
* **Auction houses** providing smart lot estimates
* **Fintech & insurance** for watch value appraisals

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python 3.x
* Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
* XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost
* NLP: spaCy / HuggingFace (optional)
* SHAP for model explainability
